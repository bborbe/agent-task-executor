# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## Unreleased
- Update dependencies, Go 1.26.5, alpine 3.24
- Ignore openpgp advisory GO-2026-5932 in govulncheck and trivy (unmaintained by design, no fix)

## v0.3.2

- fix: only append the branch as an image tag when the Config's `spec.image` has no tag
  already. Previously the resolver always did `image + ":" + branch`, so a semver-pinned image
  (`…/agent-claude:v0.1.1`) became an invalid `…:v0.1.1:dev`. Tag detection treats a `:` after
  the last `/` as an existing tag (registry-port colons excluded; digests preserved). Untagged
  images (e.g. quant-native `agent-backtest`) still get the branch tag as before. This unblocks
  semver-pinned agent images rendered by the Helm chart.

## v0.3.1

- refactor: converge build to the `bborbe/kafka-topic-reader` publish-only model — `make buca`
  now builds and pushes `docker.io/bborbe/agent-task-executor:$(VERSION)` (semver from git tag),
  replacing the private-registry `:$(BRANCH)` flow and the separate `publish` target. Deployment
  moves to the quant config repo; removed `k8s/*.yaml`, `Makefile.k8s`, `Makefile.env`, and the
  stage `.env` files (kept `k8s/apis` + `k8s/client` CRD code).

## v0.3.0

- feat: add `make publish` target to build and push a semver-tagged public image to
  Docker Hub (`docker.io/bborbe/agent-task-executor:<version>`), independent of the
  private-registry `buca` flow. Pattern mirrors `bborbe/kafka-topic-reader`.

## v0.2.0

- feat: propagate `TOPIC_PREFIX` (from `TopicPrefix` config) to spawned per-task Jobs, alongside the existing
  `BRANCH` env var, so child agents (agent-claude/code/gemini/pi/sentry-issue-analyzer) can build their Kafka
  result topics.

## v0.1.0

- feat: add explicit `TopicPrefix` config (`arg:"topic-prefix"` / `env:"TOPIC_PREFIX"`), replacing the implicit
  `Branch`-derived Kafka topic prefix. `Branch` (`env:"BRANCH"`) is unchanged and keeps its non-topic uses
  (child-job `BRANCH` env propagation, config image tagging, stage matching). Bumps
  `github.com/bborbe/agent` to v0.72.0 and `github.com/bborbe/cqrs` to v0.6.0.
